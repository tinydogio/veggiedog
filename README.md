# ü•ïüê∂ veggiedog by tinydog

_veggiedog_ is a lightweight MVC written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It is currently built using [Express](https://expressjs.com/), but this may change soon.

We are in early development and will initially be used as a backbone for our  [firedog](https://github.com/tinydogio/firedog) project.

**NOTE:** This project is not currently something you can easily just drop in your project. Instructions are coming soon for including it.

## Development Setup

**Dependencies**
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v8.9.x

Once the dependencies are installed, open the project in a terminal and enter ```npm install```.

## Build Project

Run ```npm run build``` to build the project. The output module will be found in the dist directory.
